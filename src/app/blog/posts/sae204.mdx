## Project Description

This Project was carried out as part of our training at the IUT of Colmar. It consists of several parts: web development with Django and Nginx, data collection via MQTT, and network configuration with a switch and router.

## Web Part: Django and Nginx

### Django Project Creation

- **Virtual Environment**: Set up a Python virtual environment to manage project dependencies.
- **Database Configuration**: Used MySQL with Django to store sensor data.
- **Models and Migrations**: Created Django models and executed migrations to structure the database.
- **Features**:
  - Read, update, and delete sensors.
  - Filters for data by day, hour, and temperature.
  - Export data to CSV.

### Deployment with Gunicorn and Nginx

- **Gunicorn Configuration**: Set up Gunicorn to serve the Django application.
- **Nginx Configuration**: Configured Nginx to serve static files and proxy requests to Gunicorn.

## Data Collection Part: MQTT

### Understanding and Connecting MQTT

- **MQTT Broker**: Connected to the broker `test.mosquitto.org` to receive sensor data.
- **Message Processing**: Separated and processed MQTT messages to extract sensor information.

### Database Management

- **Sensor Verification**: Checked the existence of sensors in the database before insertion.
- **Data Insertion**: Inserted sensor data into the MySQL database.

## Network Part: Switch and Router

### Switch Configuration

- **VLANs**: Configured 4 VLANs (VLAN 10, VLAN 20, VLAN 30, VLAN 40).
- **Trunk Mode**: Configured trunk mode to allow communication between VLANs.

### Router Configuration

- **Virtual Interfaces**: Configured virtual interfaces for each VLAN with different subnets.
- **NAT Overload**: Configured NAT overload to allow communication between the local network and the public network.
- **DHCP**: Configured DHCP pools for each VLAN.
- **ACLs**: Configured Access Control Lists (ACLs) to define network traffic rules.

## Skills Acquired

- **Web Development**: Used Django to create a web application.
- **Database Management**: Configured and managed MySQL with Django.
- **Application Deployment**: Used Gunicorn and Nginx to deploy a web application.
- **MQTT Protocol**: Connected and processed data via MQTT.
- **Network Configuration**: Configured switches and routers, managed VLANs, NAT, DHCP, and ACLs.
