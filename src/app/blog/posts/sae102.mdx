## Project Overview

This SAE (Situation d'Apprentissage et d'Évaluation) served as my introduction to computer networks and telecommunications. The project focused on acquiring fundamental knowledge and practical skills necessary to understand, configure, and manage local network infrastructures. Through hands-on activities, I learned the essential principles of network architecture, digital systems, and operating system interactions required for network administration.

## Fundamental Concepts

### Electrical Principles for Network Equipment

As part of this foundational learning, I studied the fundamental laws of electricity that are essential for working with network and telecommunications equipment. This knowledge is crucial for understanding:

- **Voltage, Current, and Resistance**: Basic electrical concepts that govern how network devices operate
- **Power Management**: Understanding power requirements and consumption of network equipment
- **Signal Transmission**: How electrical signals carry data through network cables and components
- **Safety Protocols**: Proper handling of electrical equipment in network environments

This theoretical foundation enabled me to work safely and effectively with network hardware components.

### Digital Systems Architecture and Information Coding

I explored the architecture and fundamentals of digital systems, learning about:

- **Binary Representation**: How information is encoded in digital systems using binary code
- **Data Encoding Principles**: Understanding how data is represented and transmitted in digital formats
- **Communication Protocols**: Introduction to how devices communicate over networks
- **Internet Fundamentals**: Basic understanding of how the Internet works as a global network of networks
- **Network Layers**: Introduction to the OSI model and TCP/IP stack concepts

This knowledge provided the conceptual framework necessary to understand how modern computer networks function.

## Local Network Configuration

### Basic Network Functions

I learned to configure the basic functions of a local network, including:

- **IP Addressing**: Configuration of static and dynamic IP addresses
- **Subnetting**: Understanding network segmentation and subnet masks
- **Gateway Configuration**: Setting up default gateways for network routing
- **DNS Configuration**: Configuring Domain Name System settings for name resolution
- **Network Interface Configuration**: Setting up and managing network adapters
- **Basic Routing**: Understanding how packets are routed within a local network

These practical skills enabled me to set up and configure basic local network infrastructures from scratch.

## Operating System Principles

### OS Interaction for Network Administration

I mastered the roles and fundamental principles of operating systems in the context of network configuration and administration:

- **Command-Line Interface**: Using terminal commands for network configuration (Linux and Windows)
- **Network Configuration Tools**: Utilizing OS-specific tools for network management
  - Linux: `ifconfig`, `ip`, `netstat`, `ss`, `systemctl`
  - Windows: `ipconfig`, `netsh`, `netstat`, PowerShell cmdlets
- **Service Management**: Understanding how network services are managed by the operating system
- **File System Permissions**: Managing access to network-related configuration files
- **Process Management**: Understanding how network services run as processes
- **System Logs**: Reading and interpreting network-related system logs for troubleshooting

This knowledge allowed me to effectively interact with operating systems to configure and administer network services.

## Network Troubleshooting

### Identifying and Reporting Network Malfunctions

I developed skills in identifying malfunctions in local networks and reporting them effectively:

- **Diagnostic Tools**: Using network diagnostic utilities:
  - `ping` for connectivity testing
  - `traceroute`/`tracert` for path analysis
  - `nslookup`/`dig` for DNS troubleshooting
  - `arp` for address resolution issues
  - `netstat`/`ss` for connection monitoring

- **Problem Identification**: Learning to recognize common network issues:
  - Connectivity problems
  - Configuration errors
  - DNS resolution failures
  - Routing issues
  - Firewall blocking

- **Documentation and Reporting**: Creating clear reports that include:
  - Problem description
  - Diagnostic steps taken
  - Error messages and logs
  - Proposed solutions
  - Network topology diagrams when relevant

This systematic approach to troubleshooting became essential for maintaining network reliability.

## Client Workstation Installation

### Installation and Procedure Documentation

I learned to install a client workstation and explain the implemented procedure in detail:

- **Operating System Installation**: 
  - Installing Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Debian, etc.)
  - Installing Windows client operating systems
  - Post-installation configuration

- **Network Configuration**: 
  - Configuring network interfaces
  - Setting up IP addresses (static/DHCP)
  - Configuring DNS servers
  - Testing network connectivity

- **Essential Software Installation**:
  - Network diagnostic tools
  - Remote access clients (SSH, RDP)
  - Network monitoring utilities

- **Security Configuration**:
  - Firewall configuration
  - User account management
  - Security updates and patches

- **Documentation**: Creating comprehensive installation procedures that include:
  - Step-by-step instructions
  - Configuration parameters used
  - Verification steps
  - Troubleshooting tips

This hands-on experience provided practical skills in workstation deployment and documentation.

## Practical Applications

Throughout this SAE, I applied these concepts through various practical exercises:

- **Network Setup**: Configuring a small local network with multiple devices
- **Configuration Management**: Using command-line and GUI tools to configure network settings
- **Troubleshooting Scenarios**: Resolving intentionally introduced network problems
- **Workstation Deployment**: Installing and configuring client workstations from scratch
- **Documentation**: Creating technical documentation for all procedures performed

## Achievements

This SAE allowed me to validate and develop the following key competencies:

- **AC11.01** | Master the fundamental laws of electricity to work on network and telecommunications equipment
- **AC11.02** | Understand the architecture and fundamentals of digital systems, the principles of information coding, communications, and the Internet
- **AC11.03** | Configure the basic functions of the local network
- **AC11.04** | Master the roles and fundamental principles of operating systems in order to interact with them for the configuration and administration of networks and provided services
- **AC11.05** | Identify malfunctions in the local network and know how to report them
- **AC11.06** | Install a client workstation and explain the implemented procedure

## Conclusion

This introductory SAE provided a solid foundation in computer networking, combining theoretical knowledge with practical hands-on experience. The skills acquired in network configuration, operating system interaction, troubleshooting, and workstation installation formed the basis for more advanced network projects in subsequent semesters. This project demonstrated the importance of understanding both the theoretical principles and practical implementation aspects of network administration.
