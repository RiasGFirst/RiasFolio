## Introduction to the School Project

As part of our academic curriculum, we undertook a comprehensive project aimed at exploring the Scapy Python library and conducting network discovery and security exercises. This project was designed to enhance our understanding of network protocols, packet manipulation, and the potential vulnerabilities in network communications. Through hands-on exercises, we gained practical experience in both passive and active network discovery, as well as simulating Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks. This project not only deepened our technical skills but also highlighted the importance of robust network security measures.

## Learning Scapy

Learning Scapy provided an invaluable opportunity to delve into the intricacies of network packet manipulation and analysis. Scapy, a powerful Python-based interactive tool, allows users to craft, send, sniff, and dissect network packets with ease. This hands-on experience was crucial for understanding the underlying mechanics of network protocols and the structure of packets. By mastering Scapy, we gained insights into network behaviors, identified potential vulnerabilities, and developed robust network security strategies. The learning process involved exploring various features of Scapy, such as packet creation, manipulation, and real-time analysis, which are essential skills for any network professional or enthusiast.

## Exercises on Passive/Active Discovery and Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks

The exercises on passive and active discovery, along with Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, were designed to provide practical insights into network reconnaissance and security vulnerabilities. Passive discovery involved monitoring network traffic to identify active hosts and services without direct interaction, thereby minimizing detection risks. Active discovery, on the other hand, entailed sending crafted packets to elicit responses and gather detailed information about the target network. The MITM exercises simulated real-world attack scenarios, demonstrating how an attacker can intercept and manipulate communications between two parties. These exercises highlighted the importance of implementing robust security measures to protect against such intrusions and underscored the critical role of continuous network monitoring and analysis.
