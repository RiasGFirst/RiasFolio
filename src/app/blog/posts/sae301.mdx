## Overview
The project involved developing a comprehensive smart home automation system that integrates a mobile application, a web interface, and two connected smart plugs. The system allows users to control the smart plugs via the web or mobile application by sending and receiving MQTT messages on ESP devices.

## Key Components

1. **Mobile Application**
   - Developed a user-friendly mobile app for seamless control of smart plugs.
   - Implemented MQTT protocol for real-time communication with ESP devices.

2. **Web Interface**
   - Built using Django, providing a robust and scalable backend.
   - Enabled users to monitor and control smart plugs through a web browser.

3. **Smart Plugs**
   - Integrated two smart plugs with ESP modules for connectivity.
   - Ensured reliable communication through MQTT messaging.

## Technical Highlights

- **MQTT Protocol**: Utilized for efficient and real-time message transmission between devices.
- **Django Framework**: Leveraged for developing a secure and scalable web interface.
- **ESP Modules**: Deployed for seamless integration and control of smart plugs.

## Achievements

- Successfully implemented a fully functional smart home automation system.
- Enabled remote control of smart plugs via both mobile and web platforms.
- Ensured robust and real-time communication through MQTT protocol.
