## Simulating a Network

In the initial phase of discovering a transmission device, the focus was on simulating a network to visualize and plan the data flow. This involved creating a virtual model of the network to identify potential issues and optimize performance before actual implementation. By using advanced simulation tools, we were able to map out the network topology and ensure efficient data transmission pathways. This step was crucial for understanding the dynamics of the network and preparing for real-world deployment.


## Establishing Connections Between Points A and B

The next step involved establishing physical connections between two key points, A and B. This process included setting up essential hardware components such as routers, switches, and cables to facilitate smooth and reliable data transmission. Careful configuration of these devices was necessary to maintain data integrity and minimize latency. By ensuring robust connections, we created a stable and efficient data transmission path that forms the backbone of the network.


## Positioning a WiFi Antenna and Conducting Tests

The final phase focused on positioning a WiFi antenna to optimize signal strength and coverage. Strategic placement of the antenna was critical for achieving the best wireless performance. Following the setup, comprehensive tests and measurements were conducted using Acrylic, a powerful network analysis tool. These tests provided valuable insights into signal quality, interference levels, and overall network health. By fine-tuning the antenna position and analyzing test results, we ensured the transmission device delivered reliable and high-speed wireless connectivity, meeting the project's objectives effectively.
