## Project Overview

In the framework of the **SAE1.03 "Découvrir un dispositif de transmission"** module, I explored the fundamental layers of network communication. This project focused on understanding how data is transmitted across different media, starting from theoretical simulation to the physical deployment and optimization of a wireless transmission system.

The objective was to master the entire lifecycle of a transmission setup: planning the topology, establishing reliable physical links, and fine-tuning wireless performance to ensure optimal signal quality.

## Technical Implementation

### Network Simulation & Planning

Before any physical intervention, the project began with a comprehensive simulation phase. This allowed for a precise visualization of the data flow and helped in identifying potential bottlenecks or interference zones.

- **Topology Modeling**: Designing a virtual representation of the network to optimize the placement of critical components.
- **Predictive Analysis**: Using simulation tools to estimate signal range and throughput before deploying hardware.
- **Problem Identification**: Early detection of configuration issues, ensuring a smoother transition to the physical deployment phase.

### Physical Infrastructure & Interconnection

The second phase involved the hands-on deployment of the network backbone. I was responsible for establishing reliable connections between two strategic points (A and B), which required a deep understanding of physical transmission media.

- **Hardware Setup**: Configuring and interconnecting professional-grade routers, switches, and cabling.
- **Link Integrity**: Ensuring data integrity by adhering to strict wiring standards and device configuration protocols.
- **Latency Optimization**: Fine-tuning hardware settings to minimize transmission delays and maximize reliability across the point-to-point link.

### WiFi Optimization & Signal Analysis

The final and most critical phase was the deployment of a wireless transmission system. Strategic positioning of the WiFi antenna was paramount to achieving the best possible coverage and performance.

- **Antenna Alignment**: Applying signal propagation principles to find the optimal physical placement for the antenna.
- **Professional Diagnostics**: Utilizing **Acrylic WiFi**, a powerful network analysis tool, to conduct detailed signal measurements and interference analysis.
- **Environmental Calibration**: Adjusting the transmission parameters based on real-world test results to overcome physical obstacles and electromagnetic interference.

## Competencies Validation: Why I have these skills

### AC12.01: Measure, analyze, and comment on signals

I have proven my ability to use professional-grade diagnostic tools to evaluate transmission quality. By interpreting complex signal data from **Acrylic**, I can identify interference patterns and propose technical solutions to improve network health.
- **Concrete Evidence**: The detailed signal reports and heatmaps generated during the testing phase, used to justify antenna repositioning.

### AC12.03: Deploy transmission media

I have mastered the physical layer of network deployment. From choosing the right cables to configuring active network equipment, I can build a stable and efficient transmission infrastructure from scratch.
- **Concrete Evidence**: The successful establishment of a high-speed, stable link between points A and B during the practical assessment.

### AC12.05: Communicate with a third party and adapt one's speech

Throughout this project, I demonstrated the ability to explain complex technical concepts to different audiences, ensuring that architectural choices were clearly understood and justified.
- **Concrete Evidence**: The technical documentation and oral presentation where I translated signal measurement data into actionable business recommendations.

## Conclusion

The SAE1.03 project provided a solid foundation in the physical and link layers of telecommunications. It bridged the gap between abstract network models and the tangible reality of hardware deployment. This experience has equipped me with the technical rigor necessary to deploy, analyze, and optimize communication systems in diverse professional environments.
