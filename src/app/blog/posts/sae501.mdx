# Project: Connected Vehicle Tracking System (IoT / LoRaWAN)

## Context and Objectives
As part of the SAE 5.01 module in the Networks and Telecommunications BUT (IUT of Colmar), I participated in the design, implementation, and presentation of a complete Internet of Things (IoT) technical solution.

The main objective was to develop a GNSS vehicle tracking system capable of transmitting its position via the LoRaWAN network (The Things Network) and visualizing the data on a map hosted on a server. This project addressed a strong energy efficiency constraint to guarantee the autonomy of the embedded system.

## Technical Architecture Implemented

### 1. Embedded System (End-Device)
For data capture and transmission, we developed a solution based on the Pycom hardware environment:

* **Hardware:** Used a Fipy or Lopy module mounted on a Pytrack board embedded in the vehicle.
* **Energy Optimization:** Developed a power management algorithm using "Deep Sleep" modes. The system only activates and connects to the network when the accelerometer detects vehicle movement.
* **Data Optimization:** Optimized encoding of latitude and longitude on 3 bytes each to reduce Airtime on the LoRa physical layer.

### 2. Network Infrastructure and Transmission
Data transport relies on the LoRaWAN protocol via The Things Network (TTN) infrastructure:

* Configuration of a LoRaWAN Gateway (based on Expansion or Pysens board) to ensure network coverage.
* Payload management (Uplink/Downlink) and JSON formatting via TTN "Payload Formatters".
* Implementation of bidirectional communications (Downlink) allowing the user to remotely put the sensor to sleep via a Web command.

### 3. Server Application and Visualization
Data processing and display are centralized on a Raspberry Pi:

* Deployment of a Node-RED flow to retrieve data via the MQTT protocol.
* Creation of a dashboard integrating mapping for real-time tracking.
* Integration of an alert system via SMS (using a 2G/3G dongle) and mobile notifications to warn the user during vehicle movements.

## Achievements

This project allowed me to mobilize and validate the following key skills from the R&T curriculum:

### Administer and Deploy (Networks and Telecoms)
* **AC32.01 | Deploy a communication system for the enterprise:** Complete implementation of the IoT communication chain, from sensor to application server.
* **AC32.02 | Deploy a wireless access network [...]:** Configuration of WiFi connections for the Gateway and management of the LoRaWAN radio link.
* **AC32.03 | Deploy a fixed or mobile access network for an operator:** Configuration and provisioning of equipment on The Things Network (TTN) operator network.

### Connect and Program (Development and System)
* **AC33.01 | Develop technical specifications:** Analysis of autonomy needs and definition of data frame format.
* **AC33.04 | Deploy and maintain an IT solution:** Installation and configuration of the Node-RED server on Raspberry Pi and maintenance of Python scripts (MicroPython) on Pycom modules.
* **AC33.05 | Stay informed about technological developments:** Self-training on LoRaWAN protocol specifics, "Duty Cycle" constraints, and the Pycom environment.

### Secure and Supervise
* **AC31.01 | Design a network project [...] integrating supervision:** Implementation of a supervision dashboard to visualize vehicle status and position in real-time.
* **AC31.03 | Create a demonstration prototype of the project:** Functional prototyping including embedded hardware and final user interface.

### Project Management and Communication
* **AC31.04 | Defend/argue a project:** Presentation of the technical solution and justification of energy optimization choices.
* **AC31.05 & AC33.02 | Collaborate in project mode:** Teamwork (3-4 students), task distribution (Gateway, End-Device, Server), and management of allocated time (27.5h).
* **AC31.02 | Produce technical documentation:** Explanation of script functioning and architectural choices.

## Personal Conclusion
This project was a concrete opportunity to link embedded electronics (sensors, energy management) to the world of operator networks (LoRaWAN) and IT (MQTT, Node-RED). I particularly developed my skills in low-power IoT and system integration.
