## Banking Management Interface â€“ Cloud Development Project

As part of the **SAE4.DEVCLOUD.01** project at IUT de Colmar, I contributed to the design and implementation of a **banking management interface** based on a **microservices architecture**. The application provides account management, user authentication, and transaction validation by bank agents.

### Key Contributions
- **Frontend Development**: Designed and implemented the user interface with a focus on seamless integration with backend services.  
- **API Communication & Security**: Managed API requests and implemented **HTTP Basic Authentication** to ensure secure data exchanges.  
- **Project Planning**: Structured tasks through a Gantt chart, ensuring clear task distribution within a two-person team.  

### Technical Approach
- **Microservices Architecture**: Each core feature was built as an independent service, improving scalability and maintainability.  
- **REST APIs**: Enabled communication between services and frontend.  
- **Cloud & Virtualization**: Deployed and tested microservices in virtualized cloud environments, using DevOps practices for continuous integration and delivery.  
- **Network Automation**: Applied Infrastructure-as-Code methods to configure and manage networking efficiently.  

### Skills & Learning Outcomes
This project validated several critical competencies:
- Proposing scalable **cloud solutions** for enterprise needs.  
- **Virtualizing environments** to simulate production.  
- Leveraging **cloud services** for deployment and management.  
- Developing, deploying, and maintaining **microservices**.  
- Applying **DevOps practices** for continuous integration and deployment.  
- Automating **network configuration** via code.  

### Reflections
The project strengthened both my **technical expertise** and my **team collaboration skills**. While microservices and cloud deployment enhanced flexibility and modularity, one of the main challenges was **team coordination**, which required careful planning and communication. These experiences will be invaluable for tackling future projects in evolving cloud environments.
