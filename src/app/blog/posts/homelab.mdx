# My Network and Virtualization Infrastructure

## Introduction

Welcome to the page dedicated to my personal network and virtualization infrastructure. I am passionate about information technology and have set up a robust infrastructure to host various services for my personal use.

## Proxmox

### Overview

Proxmox VE (Virtual Environment) is an open-source virtualization platform that allows me to easily manage virtual machines and containers. I chose Proxmox for its flexibility and ease of use.

### Hosted Services

On my Proxmox server, I host several services, including:

- **Nextcloud**: I use it to store my documents and work within a synchronized environment. This setup ensures that my files are always up-to-date and accessible from anywhere.
- **Immich**: This serves as my personal image cloud storage, allowing me to securely store and manage my photo library.
- **Authentik**: This tool helps me create and administer accounts for all my applications, providing a centralized authentication and identity management system.
- **Pterodactyl**: A web application to manage game servers. This service runs on a dedicated public IP to ensure optimal performance and reliability.
- **More apps**: Other apps can be added and used.

## MikroTik

### Overview

MikroTik is a Latvian company known for its networking solutions. I use a MikroTik router to manage my local network and establish secure connections.

### Network Configuration

With MikroTik, I have configured several advanced features, including:

- **EOIP Tunnel**: To bring up two public IP addresses so I can manage access to my self-hosted apps beyond my local network.
- **Traffic Management**: To prioritize certain types of traffic and ensure optimal quality of service.
- **Security**: To protect my network from intrusions and attacks.

## Network and Transit Management

### Overview

In my homelab setup, managing network connections and transit is crucial for ensuring reliable and efficient access to external resources. One key aspect of this management involves establishing and maintaining connections with service providers to obtain and utilize public IP addresses.

### Provider Connectivity

I manage a dedicated connection to a service provider, which allows me to procure a block of public IP addresses. These IP addresses are essential for various applications, including hosting services and managing external access to my self-hosted applications.

### Bandwidth Management

Effective bandwidth management is critical to ensure optimal performance and cost-efficiency. I monitor and manage my bandwidth usage with a focus on the 95th percentile billing method. This approach involves:

- **Traffic Monitoring**: Continuously tracking bandwidth usage to understand traffic patterns and peak usage times.
- **Commitment Management**: Ensuring that my bandwidth commitments align with the 95th percentile usage to optimize costs and avoid over-provisioning.
- **Performance Optimization**: Adjusting network configurations and traffic policies to maintain high performance and reliability.

By carefully managing my connection to the service provider and focusing on efficient bandwidth usage, I can ensure that my network remains robust, scalable, and capable of supporting my various projects and services.


## Conclusion

My network and virtualization infrastructure allows me to efficiently manage my personal services while ensuring high availability and optimal security. I continue to explore new technologies and services to improve and expand my infrastructure.
