# My Network and Virtualization Infrastructure

## Introduction

Welcome to the page dedicated to my personal network and virtualization infrastructure. I am passionate about information technology and have set up a robust infrastructure to host various services for my personal use.

## Proxmox

### Overview

Proxmox VE (Virtual Environment) is an open-source virtualization platform that allows me to easily manage virtual machines and containers. I chose Proxmox for its flexibility and ease of use.

### Hosted Services

On my Proxmox server, I host several services, including:

- **Nextcloud**: I use it to store my documents and work within a synchronized environment. This setup ensures that my files are always up-to-date and accessible from anywhere.

- **Authentik**: This tool helps me create and administer accounts for all my applications, providing a centralized authentication and identity management system.
- **Pterodactyl**: A web application to manage game servers. This service runs on a dedicated public IP to ensure optimal performance and reliability.
- **More apps**: Oter apps can be added and use.

With MikroTik, I have configured several advanced features, including:

- **EOIP Tunnel**: To bring up two public IP addresses so i can manage access to my self-hosted apps beond my local network.
- **Traffic Management**: To prioritize certain types of traffic and ensure optimal quality of service.
