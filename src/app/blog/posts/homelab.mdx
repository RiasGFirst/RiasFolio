# My Network and Virtualization Infrastructure

## Introduction

Welcome to the page dedicated to my personal network and virtualization infrastructure. I am passionate about information technology and have set up a robust infrastructure to host various services for my personal use.

## Proxmox

### Overview

Proxmox VE (Virtual Environment) is an open-source virtualization platform that allows me to easily manage virtual machines and containers. I chose Proxmox for its flexibility and ease of use.

### Hosted Services

On my Proxmox server, I host several services, including:

- **Nextcloud**: I use it to store my documents and work within a synchronized environment. This setup ensures that my files are always up-to-date and accessible from anywhere.
- **Immich**: This serves as my personal image cloud storage, allowing me to securely store and manage my photo library.
- **Authentik**: This tool helps me create and administer accounts for all my applications, providing a centralized authentication and identity management system.
- **Pterodactyl**: A web application to manage game servers. This service runs on a dedicated public IP to ensure optimal performance and reliability.
- **More apps**: Other apps can be added and used.

## MikroTik

### Overview

MikroTik is a Latvian company known for its networking solutions. I use a MikroTik router to manage my local network and establish secure connections.

### Network Configuration

With MikroTik, I have configured several advanced features, including:

- **EOIP Tunnel**: To bring up two public IP addresses so I can manage access to my self-hosted apps beyond my local network.
- **Traffic Management**: To prioritize certain types of traffic and ensure optimal quality of service.
- **Security**: To protect my network from intrusions and attacks.

## Network and Transit Management

### Overview

Effective network and transit management are crucial for ensuring seamless connectivity and optimal performance across different networks. This involves managing how data travels between my local network and external networks, including the internet.

### Interconnection Management

Interconnection management is about handling the connections between different networks to ensure efficient and reliable data transfer. Here are some key aspects of my interconnection management strategy:

- **Peering**: Establishing direct connections with other networks to exchange traffic. This reduces latency and improves bandwidth efficiency. I use peering to connect with local internet service providers and content delivery networks.

- **Transit Providers**: Using transit providers to reach parts of the internet not covered by peering agreements. This ensures global connectivity and access to all internet resources.

- **Redundancy**: Implementing redundant connections to ensure high availability. This means having multiple paths for data to travel, so if one path fails, traffic can be rerouted through another path without disruption.

- **Monitoring and Optimization**: Continuously monitoring network performance and optimizing routes to ensure the best possible performance. This includes using tools to analyze traffic patterns and make adjustments as needed.

By focusing on these areas, I can ensure that my network is robust, reliable, and capable of handling the demands of my personal and professional projects.

## Conclusion

My network and virtualization infrastructure allows me to efficiently manage my personal services while ensuring high availability and optimal security. I continue to explore new technologies and services to improve and expand my infrastructure.
