## Overview

Developed a multi-server architecture designed to handle client requests for compiling and executing programs. The system efficiently manages load balancing across servers to ensure smooth and scalable execution, capable of handling multiple concurrent clients.

## Key Features

- **Client-Server Interaction**: Graphical client interface for submitting programs and receiving results.
- **Load Balancing**: Dynamic task delegation to secondary servers based on CPU usage and queue size.
- **Concurrency**: Handles multiple client requests simultaneously.
- **Socket Communication**: Robust communication between clients and servers, including error handling and reconnection mechanisms.

## Technical Highlights

- **Program Execution**: Supports multiple programming languages with necessary compilation tools.
- **Resource Monitoring**: Tracks CPU and memory load for informed load balancing decisions.
- **Security**: Implements authentication and encrypted communications for secure client-server exchanges.

## Achievements

- Successfully implemented a scalable and robust multi-server system.
- Developed a user-friendly client interface and efficient server-side functionalities.
- Ensured dynamic scalability and effective load management for handling multiple clients and servers.
