## Instructions

Worked as part of a team to implement a multisite network using protocols such as RIP, OSPF, BGP, route reflector, vpnv4, VRF, and NAT.

## Implementation

- **Multisite Network**: Designed and configured a multisite network architecture.
- **Routing Protocols**: Implemented RIP, OSPF, and BGP for efficient routing across sites.
- **Route Reflector**: Utilized route reflectors to optimize BGP configurations.
- **VPN and VRF**: Configured vpnv4 and VRF for secure and isolated network segments.
- **NAT**: Applied NAT for address translation and network security.
